# Na'an
A card game, where Shify the elf is going to cheat. We pick our numbers first and then submit them. I'm guessing Shifty then reads these numbers and then creates his hand with a lower and hgh number that will beat us no matter what. 

But we know this application is written in python, so what if this app is suceptible to a `NaN` [vulnerability]('https://www.tenable.com/blog/python-nan-injection')?

Let's try adding values that will be converted into `NaN`s?
